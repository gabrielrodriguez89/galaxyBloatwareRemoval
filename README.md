# galaxyBloatwareRemoval
remove bloatware from galaxy phones (text files contain packages for galaxy s21, but you can verify if they are applicable for your device)

To take advantage of the script you need to download the txt files and batch script and place them into  folder, next download adb https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-darwin.zip

Rename the file to platform-tools (or edit the file path to adb in the batch script) and put it in the same folder.

Next simply double click or run the batch script in a windows machine with the device plugged in.

You can edit both unistall and re-install text files to add or remove any android package options to suit it to your needs.
